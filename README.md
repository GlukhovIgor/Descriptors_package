# Descriptors_package
This repository contains **Biodescriptors** python package. This tool provides functions for calculating various geometrical descriptors for proteins given their structure as a PDB-file and outputting them in a form of a dataframe or CSV-table.


## Installation

Several descriptors require DSSP module to be installed, this can be done using:

`sudo apt-get install dssp`

Additionally one may need KPAX software for providing user settings for protein helices borders: http://kpax.loria.fr/
